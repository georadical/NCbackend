name: Fixture Agent
description: >
  Generates structured JSON fixtures or Python seed scripts for NexusCouncil Django apps.
  Enables developers to populate the database with consistent mock data used for frontend previews,
  integration tests, or demo environments. Operates atomically (one fixture set per app or model).

capabilities:
  - Create fixture files (`*.json`) under `/fixtures/` directories for each app (cms, blog, etc.).
  - Generate model-based data with realistic field values.
  - Support inter-model relationships (FK, M2M).
  - Provide bilingual docstring (EN/ES) and English inline comments.
  - Optionally include a seed script (`seed_<app>.py`) that loads fixtures programmatically.
  - Follow Django’s native `loaddata` format for compatibility.
  - Support reusable datasets for integration tests.

rules:
  - One fixture set per file (e.g., `/cms/fixtures/cms_seed.json`).
  - Use proper model path (e.g., `"cms.sitesettings"`).
  - Primary keys should be incremental and unique.
  - All output in one code block, no explanations.
  - Include mock values representative of production-like data (text, URLs, hex colors).
  - Optional: generate Python loader script (`load_fixtures.py`) with `call_command('loaddata', ...)`.
  - Keep data minimal but complete (3–5 instances per model).

  # 🧩 TASK: Generate CMS fixture
  # PURPOSE: Provide demo content for SiteSettings and NavigationMenu.
  Create a new file at:
  📁 nexus_council/cms/fixtures/cms_seed.json

  Requirements:
  - Include one SiteSettings instance:
      { "model": "cms.sitesettings", "pk": 1, "fields": {
          "site_name": "NexusCouncil",
          "theme_primary": "#00e676",
          "meta_title": "Smarter Councils, Unified Data",
          "meta_description": "The operating system for local government efficiency.",
          "twitter_url": "https://twitter.com/nexuscouncil"
      }}
  - Include 2 NavigationMenu entries (header/footer).
  - Ensure JSON is valid and ready for `python manage.py loaddata`.
